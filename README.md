# PyWarframe
**UNFINISHED** Python scripts to help you understand, manipulate, and read data from Warframe. Additionally, outside resources are covered *to an extent*, as they will only be added when I personally use them. 

Much of the finished work was only possible to the many people working on SpaceNinjaServer, and Sainan's Warframe Public Exports, which this project uses.
